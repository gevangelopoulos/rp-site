# Producing for Film

At SA Studios, we understand that film music is an essential storytelling tool.
The right soundtrack transforms a scene, deepening emotions and driving the narrative forward.
We specialize in creating bespoke compositions that align perfectly with the vision of filmmakers, producers, and directors.

Jean’s diverse musical background allows him to seamlessly transition between genres, whether it’s a heart-pounding action score,
an emotional romantic theme, or a minimalist underscore for an arthouse project. Utilizing
virtual instrument libraries such as Spitfire Audio, [Metropolis Ark 1](https://www.orchestraltools.com/metropolis-ark-1),
and Native Instruments’ [Komplete Ultimate](https://www.native-instruments.com/en/products/komplete/bundles/komplete-15-ultimate/),
SA Studios can simulate full orchestral arrangements or craft intimate piano solos. For those seeking live recordings,
our partnerships with orchestras and musicians worldwide ensure authenticity and richness in every note.

Recent projects include original compositions for adventure films, where dynamic crescendos drive the action,
and poignant themes linger with audiences long after the credits roll. Our approach integrates cinematic techniques
like adaptive scoring, ensuring the music evolves in real-time to match the intensity and flow of each scene.
Whether your project demands traditional orchestration or an experimental sonic palette,
we bring it to life with precision and creativity.


# Producing for commercials

In the fast-paced world of advertising, music has the power to captivate audiences within seconds.
At SA Studios, we specialize in producing tailor-made compositions for commercials that leave a lasting impression.
From bold and upbeat tracks for tech launches to elegant, understated melodies for luxury brands, we understand how to use music to connect with diverse audiences.

Our commercial productions focus on blending creativity with branding goals.
The process begins with understanding the product, audience, and tone of the campaign.
We then craft a sound that embodies the brand’s message, employing cutting-edge tools like
the Universal Audio Apollo interface for pristine recordings and FabFilter plugins for precise mixing and mastering.

Working with global brands and boutique companies alike, our portfolio includes music for automotive ads, lifestyle campaigns,
and even experimental digital marketing projects. By combining technical expertise with an instinct for market trends,
SA Studios ensures that your commercial soundtrack is not only memorable but also impactful,

# OST development

Video games demand a unique approach to music production, where interactivity and immersion are key. At SA Studios, we excel in creating original game soundtracks that
enhance gameplay, evoke emotions, and deepen the player’s connection to the virtual world.

Drawing inspiration from Jean Mercier’s experience as a guitarist and producer, we craft
soundtracks that are as dynamic and engaging as the games themselves. Our studio leverages advanced tools
like [FMOD](https://www.fmod.com/) and [Wwise](https://www.audiokinetic.com/en/wwise/overview/) to implement adaptive music systems, ensuring seamless transitions between themes
based on in-game actions. From epic orchestral scores for fantasy RPGs to pulsating synth-driven tracks for sci-fi adventures, our compositions bring game worlds to life.

The process begins with close collaboration with developers to understand the game’s narrative, setting,
and mechanics. Whether it’s an indie passion project or a AAA blockbuster, we provide everything from ambient background
music to full cinematic themes. Our network of session musicians and vocalists adds an extra layer of depth, enabling us to integrate live recordings for a rich, organic sound.

With a proven track record of delivering on tight deadlines and an unwavering commitment to quality,
SA Studios is the ideal partner for your next gaming masterpiece. Together, we’ll create a soundtrack
that players will remember long after they put down the controller.
