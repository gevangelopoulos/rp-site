At our online music mixing service, we take your multitrack recording and deliver a balanced mix where all
instruments and vocals come together seamlessly. The result is a harmony that reflects your style, genre, composition,
and theme. While the final mix may sound natural and effortless, it’s the product of careful craftsmanship, experience,
and a detailed creative process.


# What is Audio Mixing?
Audio mixing involves combining individual tracks—such as vocals, instruments, and effects—into a cohesive stereo sound.
These tracks, and their grouped stems, are adjusted and balanced to ensure clarity, depth, and alignment with the intended
artistic vision.

# What is Mastering?

Mastering is the final step of audio production, preparing tracks for distribution by ensuring consistency, loudness,
and compatibility across playback systems.Online streaming services like Spotify, Apple Music, and Tidal have specific
[loudness targets](https://support.spotify.com/uk/artists/article/loudness-normalization/) and audio quality requirements that mastering engineers must meet.
The same goes for physical formats like CDs and vinyl records.
