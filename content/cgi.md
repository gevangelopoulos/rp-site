# Deep Immersion, at Your Measures

Reverse Polarity, founded in 2019 by Jean Mercier, merges artistic
vision with cutting-edge technology to craft visually stunning, emotionally
compelling computer-generated imagery (CGI). We specialize in creating
immersive, interactive experiences for museums, nightclubs, galleries, and
venues. Every project is customized to deliver unique visual narratives that
captivate and engage audiences.

Our expertise includes parametric and generative art, drawing inspiration from
fractals, natural growth patterns, and self-organization. By integrating
advanced technologies like [gesture recognition](https://derivative.ca/community-post/how-setup-face-tracking-touchdesigner/66794)
, facial expression tracking, and hand-motion detection, we create art that reacts to its audience. Each viewer
becomes an active participant in the visual experience, fostering a deep and
lasting connection with the medium. We are dedicated to pushing creative
boundaries, ensuring each project is as impactful as it is memorable.
